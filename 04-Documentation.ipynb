    "Documentation is a part of software development that is often overlooked. In the rush to produce results, it can seem like a waste of time writing documentation when you could instead be fixing bugs or adding new features. However, good documentation is vital for good code: why should someone trust your code is producing the correct results if they have no idea how it works? \n",

Detailed descriptions of testing are given to demonstrate that the apparatus are performing as designed and so any new results can be trusted. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computational science, we should aim for similar standards. The algorithm and its implementation should ideally be described in enough detail for someone who does not have access to the original source code to implement it themselves and reproduce your results. Tests should be described to demonstrate the functionality of the code and show it is performing as described. \n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation also helps other users of the code. It's likely that at some point you will want to show or give your code to someone else.
