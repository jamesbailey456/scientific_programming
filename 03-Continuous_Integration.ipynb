    "So, you've written a set of tests for your code, you run them and everything passes - great! However, you then go back to work on developing your code and quickly forget about testing it. A few months later, after implementing several new features and refactoring several important functions, you remember to try testing your code again. You run the set of tests, only to find that they fail. At this point, you face trawling through months of changes to try and locate where the bugs were first introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could have been prevented if you had run your tests regularly, updating them often so that they reflect changes to your code. However, remembering to do this manually is less than ideal, plus it would be nice to have some kind of log of test results for each version of your code so you can avoid repeating past mistakes (as you can see things that broke the code in the past and avoid doing that again). \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this is continuous integration. This is a way of automating your tests so that they are run regularly (e.g. every night, every time you push changes to a repository), generating reports of test results for you to peruse at leisure and notifying you (almost) instantly when tests fail. Assuming you have a comprehensive, effective set of tests, you can now go ahead and develop your code safe in the knowledge that if you break something, you should find out almost as soon as you have committed (and pushed) the change and therefore be able to fix it before the buggy code becomes too entrenched.

It keeps track of code coverage for each version of the code, providing a graphical interface which highlights which exact lines are covered / not covered by testing, and generally provides a lot of graphs and features which make monitoring the coverage of your tests a lot easier.
